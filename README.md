<h2> Abstract <h2/>
<h3> This project showcases a web application for analyzing a dataset of animation movies. We conducted an analysis on approximately 51,000 movies, yielding insightful results. The frontend system was crafted using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while the backend employed Python with Flask to develop APIs. MongoDB was chosen to handle the data due to its ability to handle unstructured datasets. Our analysis delved into various aspects such as revenue, budget, popularity, and genre trends in movies. In essence, this project provides a data-driven platform for gaining insights into audience preferences and industry dynamics in the film sector, offering valuable support for strategic decision-making by stakeholders <h3/>
